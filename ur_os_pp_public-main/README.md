The UR-OS simulator is a Java-based application that plans to include all the main active elements of a computer system, 
to replicate the behavior of an operating system and its relationship with hardware elements like the processor, memory, file system, etc. 
It presents a modular design that allows the selection of different combinations of algorithms for each function. 
The current version, 0.0.3.8, is focused on the process planning function. This version implements FCFS only and does not have an implementation 
of the performance indicators, as these were part of the class projects. All faculty and researchers interested in accessing the full code can 
request access via email (pedro.wightman@urosario.edu.co) and any application with the code must give credit for authorship.

This simulator was created by Pedro Wightman, associate professor of the School of Engineering, Science and Technology at Universidad del Rosario, Bogota, Colombia.

This program is a Netbeans 20 project compiled with Java 17. The project does not include external libraries apart from the JSE SDK package.
